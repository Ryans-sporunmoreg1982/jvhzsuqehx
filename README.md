Just walked out of Deva. My head’s still spinning like when you stand up too fast after hours on a bad chair...yeah my back is killing me. Theater was a mad cacophony, could hardly hear my thoughts over the endless crinkle of popcorn bags—it was like a popcorn storm in there, and I'm picking crumbs out of my shoes. Anyway, this movie man...Deva, something about it is sticking to my brain like gum on a hot sidewalk.

The opening scene? Totally got me. It’s like, boom, you're caught right from the start and not a seat squeaking could ruin that. The colors were like a painter just spilled his mind on the screen. Visuals as if a peacock decided to throw itself a flashy dinner party. I guess it was beautiful. I mean, how can anything not be when the screen screams in neon like a disco ball?

> The characters felt real but not. Not real as in a mirror image but like, like they borrowed souls from ancient myths. That main character...Deva, right? Can't pin them down, like the wind but also like... like a paperclip holding together a dozen sticky notes that make zero sense but you feel they mean something deep. Oh, someone asked me to download the movie later for another viewing — guess we're all trying to catch what was missed.

There were moments, split-second fragments, when everything seemed clear—then poof! Confusion, like trying to read with fogged glasses. It carried this chaotic serenity that pulled me along like the tide, and there were sequences, yeah — where reality and whatever Deva’s world is, kinda blurred like a clumsy watercolor painting subjected to rain. 

Sat there with my jaw slack, wondering why my brain insisted on comparing it to the buzzing of a thousand mechanical bees on a space journey. God, why does my mind do this? But yeah, you should really watch the movie. There's something electric about it, even if it feels like an enigmatic onion—you peel and peel but half the layers vanish leaving behind something profound yet unclear. Was it profound? Or am I overthinking like I always do with my cereal in the morning?

Hold on, what was that other thing Deva did? Released a dozen birds from a cage they never had? An ode to freedom, too cliché? Too... something? How do you wrap that kind of scene in words? More questions than answers, like a riddle wrapped in an enigma inside a movie ticket.

And would you just listen to me ramble like a half-baked philosopher—it's just a movie! But then, no, it isn't—it's a tapestry, a muddy kinda puzzle quilt made of pixels. Anyone said the art is lost is clearly not downloading the movie and soaking their poor brains in it like tenderizing meat.

Oh, uh, darn. Did I mess up my notes again? Anyway...

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
    // What was I doing here again?
    int movieImpact = 0;
    string brainFog = null;
    while (confusion && awe)
    {
        ParseEmotions();
        // I'm lost;
    }
    return null;
}
```
